## React application

* Retrieve data from a server (use Superagent) and render out a table with number and stats. This should include a "Loading Animation" while loading the data

* Create small, re-usable components that you can use in multiple places. So they would have "props" that will change either some text or even some other minor layout

* Should be able to develop components using Storybook

* Should be able to test a component using Jest and React Testing Library

* Should use Styled Components for CSS


## Here are a couple extra:


* Should favour functional components for most situations instead of classes

* Should now use hooks for local state in functional components

* Should use redux to manage global state (using new redux hooks would be bonus points)

## Technical questions (TBD)

* If you had more time to spend on the test, what would you like to add to your solution?

* What browsers should your test work in? What will happen if we test it in older browsers like IE10?
